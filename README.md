Your Claude Code crew, in the cloud.

Sky runs Claude Code agents on your own servers while you're away. Point it at a GitHub repo, hand an agent a prompt, and it works in its own session and branch, asks you when it needs an answer or an approval, and tells you when it's done. You drive it from a REST API, a CLI, an MCP server (so a chat bot can dispatch work), and signed webhooks.

Sky is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.

## Where to use it

Sky is self-hosted: there is no shared instance. Deploy your own with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#deploy); every example below uses `https://<your-app>.fly.dev`.

## Auth

Every call carries the API key you set at deploy time:

```
Authorization: Bearer <SKY_API_KEY>
```

A missing or wrong key returns `401`.

## CLI

```
sky apply env.yaml
```

Creates or updates the environment `env.yaml` describes, waits until it's provisioned, and writes `sky-lock.json` beside it:

```yaml
name: web
repo: owner/name # GitHub repo, cloned once per environment
setup: pnpm install # shell script run once after the clone
concurrency: 3 # agents running at once (default 3)
approvalPolicy: [Bash] # tool names whose calls wait for your approval
```

```
sky secret set web NPM_TOKEN < token.txt
```

Stores a secret on an environment; on a terminal it prompts without echo. `sky --help` lists the options, the config file location, and exit codes.

## REST API

All routes live under `/v1`. Ids are prefixed: `env_…`, `agent_…`, `run_…`.

**Launch an agent** in a ready environment:

```
POST /v1/agents
{ "envId": "env_abc", "prompt": "Fix the flaky login test" }
```

`202 Accepted`, with `Location: /v1/agents/<agentId>/runs/<runId>` and a body of `{ "agent": …, "run": … }`.

| `POST /v1/environments` · `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE /v1/environments/:id` | environments; create returns `202` while provisioning  |

| `env_not_ready`   | the environment isn't ready to launch agents yet                             |
| `provisioning`    | the environment is still provisioning; wait for it to finish                 |
| `agents_exist`    | repo or setup can't change while unarchived agents exist                     |

## MCP

`POST /mcp` (streamable HTTP, same bearer key) exposes `create_env`, `launch`, `followup`, `status`, `answer`, `approve` and `stop`, so a chat bot can dispatch and answer agents.

## Webhooks

Events: `run.started`, `run.progress`, `run.waiting`, `run.finished`, `run.failed`, `run.stopped`. Each delivery carries `Sky-Event-Type`, `Sky-Event-Id`, and

```
Sky-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of "<t>.<body>">
```

keyed with your `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`. A failed delivery is retried with backoff, up to 30 attempts.
